# Project Phase 1 – Image Segmentation

This project focuses on **image segmentation** using the UNet architecture and its variations. The models were implemented from scratch in PyTorch and evaluated on segmentation tasks.

## Implemented Models
- **UNet**
- **Attention UNet**
- **Residual Attention UNet**

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Dice Score

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies.
2. Run the notebook `Project_Phase1.ipynb` or use the provided Python script.
3. Check the evaluation metrics and visual results inside the notebook.

The project also includes a presentation video explaining the methodology and results.(Due to the limitations of the coursework, it is in Persian.)

# Project Phase 2 – Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

This project implements the **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** reinforcement learning algorithm. SAC is an off-policy algorithm that maximizes both the expected reward and policy entropy, encouraging better exploration during training.

## Key Features
- Implementation of SAC from scratch
- Training in physics-based environments (PyBullet)
- Utility functions for visualization of training progress
- Performance demonstration videos included

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies, including PyBullet.
2. Run the notebook `SAC_notebook.ipynb` or the provided Python script.
3. Visualize the training process and review the agent’s performance in the videos.

The project includes presentation and demonstration videos for better understanding (Due to the limitations of the coursework, it is in Persian.):
